# Real-Time-Speech-Recognition
# Speech-to-Text for Transcription Services

This project implements a Transformer-based Speech-to-Text (STT) model optimized for transcription services. It combines the power of a pretrained Wav2Vec2 encoder with a custom Transformer decoder to convert raw audio waveforms into accurate textual transcripts.

## 📌 Overview

The model is designed to:
- Transcribe spoken language in audio recordings into readable text.
- Utilize pretrained self-supervised models for efficient feature extraction.
- Fine-tune decoding with a Transformer-based architecture for accurate sequence generation.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- **Encoder**: Pretrained `Wav2Vec2` (from Facebook AI) extracts robust features from raw audio.
- **Decoder**: Custom Transformer decoder layers with positional encoding and multi-head attention for generating transcriptions.
